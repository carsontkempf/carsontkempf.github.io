### [Workout Database](https://github.com/carsontkempf/WorkoutDatabase)

A web application developed to manage and track workout routines efficiently. This project demonstrates my proficiency in full-stack web development using the Flask framework and showcases my approach to building scalable and user-friendly applications.

- **Key Features and Design Process**:
  - **Backend Development**: Leveraged Flask to create a robust backend that dynamically generates content and handles user interactions. Utilized Flask-SQLAlchemy for seamless integration with a PostgreSQL database.
  - **Frontend Design**: Designed a responsive and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Employed Jinja2 templating to dynamically render content based on user actions.
  - **Data Security**: Implemented secure data handling practices, including the use of secure cookies and HTTPS protocols.
  - **Error Handling and Logging**: Integrated comprehensive error handling mechanisms and logging tools.
  - **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Jinja2.

- **Design Approach**:
  - **Modularity**: Organized code into modular components to promote reusability and simplify maintenance.
  - **User Experience**: Prioritized ease of use and a clean UI for enhanced user experience.
  - **Performance Optimization**: Employed efficient database queries and optimized server responses for scalability.
